### Project overview:
	* You can find a modal window to choose a size of products by clicking on button "Order"
	on main page.
	* Css Animations were used for a beatifull animation not only buttons, but also backgrounds
	of titles on every page and a mobile menu.
	* SVG Animations were used to animate a button for openning and closing a mobile menu.
	* I chose a library Swiper to realize a slider of reviews (section "Reviews" on main page).
	* Responsive Web Design is achieved through flexboxes and media expressions. 
	* Every image is a responsive image — image that works well on devices with widely differing
	screen sizes and resolutions. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits
	the current view and/or device. I used <picture> element to add more flexibility when 
	specifying image resources.
